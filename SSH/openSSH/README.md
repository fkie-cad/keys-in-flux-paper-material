# OpenSSH Research Folder

This directory does not contain our analysis framework.  
Instead, it includes our exploratory work and prototypes that we used while developing SSH decryption and traffic analysis techniques.

We are publishing it for transparency and for anyone who wants to follow our workflow, understand how we recovered SSH session keys, and reproduce our reasoning. 
The actual code of our framework can be found in the doker folder.
